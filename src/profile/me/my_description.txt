Hi, my Name is André Vizinha.
I've a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science done in Instituto Politécnico de Lisboa. I was enrolled between 2019 and 2024.
During my bachelor's degree I learned how to program in Kotlin (using several frameworks like SpringBoot, Android, JetPack compose, coroutines), in Java, in Javascript (React and nodeJS), in C and also dabbled in Pyhton and Matlab.
During my Bachelor's I also learned Sql, Linux, Docker and the details behing the JVM.
During my Bachelor's degree've done several projects, mainly I did an upgrade to a WSL called Htmlflow link:https://github.com/xmlet/HtmlFlow
    This DSL was created for Java and the migration I did was to make the DSL more natural to be used in a Kotlin environment.
    This DSL also used code generation based on a config file. I did an upgrade on the libraries and logic used for the code generation for this WSL.

My work Experience:
From August 2023 to August 2025 I've worked at Crossjoin Solutions, a portugue consulting company mainly focused on performance.
While working at CrossJoin Solutions, my client was a Major Canadian telecommunications operator. I spent around 5 months in the client's office (in Canada) during this time.
From October 2023 until June 2025 I worked as Application support, supported several applications, databases and servers.
The applications were mainly deployed as micro services in kubernetes in Azure cloud. 
The programming languages used were Java (Spring Boot), as the back end and Javascript (Angular), as the front ent.
The databases supported were Cassandra, MySql, Oracle, Redis.
The servers were using linux.
My job here was to troubleshoot performance and application problems, at infraestructure or at code level.
The tools used were dynatrace, azure application insights.

From June 2025 until August 2025 I worked at Automation, mainly writing scripts in bash and python and using Jira automation and azure devops release and pipelines to automate releases.

I'm currently working at CrossJoin Solutions as a Automation engineer for a Major Canadian telecomunications operator.

I love development more specially Kotlin (Android), and i'm learning how to use AI to create agents to automate tasks.
